Crazy 8's

Count down from eight while shaking each limb sequentially. Once you are done with each countdown, start again with seven, and so on. Raise energy with each subsequent countdown.

This exercise gets improvisers loose and physically warmed up.

Red Ball

Start by throwing an imaginary red ball to someone in a circle. Make sure you make eye-contact before you throw, and say, "red ball." The catcher should repeat, "red ball," and then pass it to another person in the circle. When you are comfortable, start adding objects to the circle, like "blue frisbee," or "silver diamond," and pass this around at the same time. After some time has passed, yell, "freeze," and see if you can find who has each object.

This exercise forces improvisers to listen, strengthens object work, and familiarizes new players.

Pattern Game

Everyone stands in a circle. The instructor gives person 1 the word, "cotton", and person one says, "cotton makes me think of blankets which makes me think of snuggle bear." Then person 2 says, "the snuggle bear makes me think of laundry which makes me think of my mom."
